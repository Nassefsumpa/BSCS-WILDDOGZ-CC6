The information in the form of oral speeches or written text that is passed on from one person to another is known as knowledge
The amount of human knowledge can’t be measured in terms of Gigabyte or terabyte
The quest for knowledge is a journey without a destination and human beings should not stop that quest
Our knowledge on the working and the origin of the universe is very limited
Scientists and engineers work day in and day out for many years to gather knowledge on how the universe works
Wisdom stems from the knowledge a person has gained  over years or decades
Knowledge might not come necessarily by experience but will come through avid reading and interacting with people
The scientific knowledge and theory that are postulated decades back has given rise to the technological revolution that we are witnessing today
Even when we human beings think that we have enough knowledge on the working of the universe, nature keeps throwing new phenomenon at us as witnessed during the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020
The day human beings stop their quest for knowledge is the day the progress of human civilization ceases.
